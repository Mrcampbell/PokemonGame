Your name is custom, but you play the role as a Junior Trainer from Gen I.  You start with a Growlithe named Archie, and an cyborg Umbreon
(juries still out on what species it will be).  But you rescue it in your first mission. The differences will be that it is 
steel type on top of its existing nature.

Similar to Pokemon Go, it will be location based.  You provide your Zip Code, and at first, your location determines the species.
then, as you progress through the game, it will be weather based.  I'm thinking of giving away 'Plane Tickets' where you can spend
the day in other regions catching their local pokemon for the day.

The bad guys are Team Jet.  They are a splinter group of Team Rocket, but feel far superior.  They escaped the PokeVerse and settled
here on this planet to be away from anyone who could stand up against them.  They came in Genesis Pods, each one divided by species
type.  As in, there is a Bug GP, a Water GP, and other divisions (Not only based on Element Type).  Each one is trying to find 
something new about the species. The Bug type GP is trying to figure out how to create a Super bug to help them make silks that
are stronger than Steel.  So, there will be a Sick Steel type super Bug at the end that you can capture after beating the Team Jet
Members along the way. Another, farfetched, idea would be an Evolution Pod where the end boss is an Eevee meshed with a Ditto 
that detects your weakness and morphs into the elemental advantage.
